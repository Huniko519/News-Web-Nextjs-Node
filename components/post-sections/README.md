# Post Sections

Post sections dictate the layouts for lists of posts. They are collections of various tile types in the /cmponents/post-items directory. Post sections are used on category pages, topic pages, author pages, and the homepage. The 9x Puff is also used for the "Show More" inifinite scroll.


@TODO describe the layout and wrapper classes
